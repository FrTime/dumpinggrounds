    <p>I am a manager at a small printing company located in Henrico County near the Richmond Raceway.  
        I am fairly new to Richmond and live in the Museum District with my wife Laura.  
        We have a a jack russell named Ida as well as a cat named Diego.</p>
    <p>I play the banjo as well as guitar and love bluegrass music.  
        My wife is an RN doing labor and delivery and we enjoy hiking and camping in our free time.  
        We are both dissatisfied with our careers and are taking it in turns to make changes.  
        After completing this course I hope to support her in whatever career change she is working for.</p>
